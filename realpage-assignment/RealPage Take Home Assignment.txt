Constraints: 
	• Use Open AI or Gemini API key of an LLM of your choice.
			§ If you wish to use an LLM of your choice outside of Open AI/Gemini, you'll have to provide API key for testing. 
	• The final code should be shared in a zipped folder or a GitHub link that can be run locally.  
			§ Please provide your API key for testing if using paid LLMs. 
	• If familiar, use the streamlit app for Chat UI or any other UI app of choice.  
	• If you use a db or vector store, please share the local db/vectorstore file.   
	• Provide instructions to run the code and the model used.
